# Navigation 2 (Nav2) Extensions

navigation2_extensions is a new repository that integrates Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA) functionality with the open-source Navigation2 (Nav2) ADS platform. Along with the core components of Nav2, this repository also relies on the “nav2_route” package for defining road networks used by the ADS. This release targets automated port drayage where a semi-truck communicates with an infrastructure computer within a port to coordinate the pickup and drop-off of cargo. Additionally, an emergency stop feature has been added to stop the vehicle via remote input if necessary.
